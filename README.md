![The basic idea....to be minimized more](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schnoog/FFThumbstick/main/files/Ideasketch1.jpg)






## Idea
Minimize the well know 4-strain gauges analog joystick approach to have it in a size suitable for use in diy HOTAS...

## Project progress...
Initially I hoped to be able to do everything in PETG, however that gives me after applying force for a longer duration is shift in the 0-point.

That's why I decided to print the stick part in TPU and enforce the part which shouldn't bend with an internal screw....
